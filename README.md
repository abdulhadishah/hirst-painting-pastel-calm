# 🎨 Hirst Painting - Pastel Calm

A generative dot painting inspired by Damien Hirst, built using Python Turtle Graphics. Each run produces a calm, pastel-toned grid of evenly spaced dots with subtle variation and a gallery-style feel.

## ✨ Technologies

- `Python`
- `Turtle Graphics`
- `Random`

## 🚀 Features

- 10×10 generative dot grid
- Soft pastel color palette
- Calm, paper-like background
- Randomized color placement on every run
- Minimal, distraction-free visual output

## 📍 The Process

This project was built as **Day 18 of the 100 Days of Python Code** course to better understand Turtle graphics and its documentation. The focus was on working with Python modules, importing packages, RGB color modes, tuples, and coordinate-based drawing. Starting from a simple grid, the project evolved through palette refinement and contrast tuning to achieve a calm, balanced aesthetic.
